# TicTacToe
Simple game of Tic Tac Toe against an intelligent computer opponent. Uses a graphical user interface to display board and moves.

The computer works as follows: It starts with a random move, after that it always tests to see if it has an available winning move, 
if it does then it makes the move and wins. If there is no immediate winning move then it checks to see if the opponent has a possible
winning move on their next turn and if they do then it will block that move. If there is no winning moves for either player then it
makes a random move.

Could further improve upon this to make the computer try to work towards winning moves if none are available instead of just going 
randomly.
